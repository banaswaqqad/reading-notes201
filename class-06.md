# Understanding The Problem Domain  

they said that Understanding The Problem Domain is The Hardest Part Of Programming 

### Why problem domains are hard ?
Writing code is a lot like putting together the puzzle's peaces .  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.

The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.

**Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain**

The more and more I write code, the more I learn that understanding the problem is the most critical piece to the equation.
 It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question. 
  It’s like buzzing in on Jeopardy before you hear the clue and shouting out random questions.

### What can you do about it?
If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

1. Make the problem domain easier
2. Get better at understanding the problem domain

**You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.**

What I mean by this is that it is often beneficial to take a part of the problem and fully understand that part before expanding the problem domain.


# WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model 
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, 
variables and functions take on new names.

Like variables and named functions, 
properties and methods have a 
name and a value. **In an object**, 
that name is called a key. 
An object cannot have two keys 
with the same name. This is 
because keys are used to access 
their corresponding values. 
The value of a property can be a 
string, number, Boolean, array, or 
even another object. The value of a 
method is always a function.
