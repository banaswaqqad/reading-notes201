# IMAGES
Controlling the size and alignment of our images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of our page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

We can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS.

Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

Where the `<img>` elements appear in the HTML, rather than using width and height attributes we can use these names as values for the class attribute. In the CSS, we add selectors for each of the class names, then use the CSS width and height properties to control the image dimensions.

Background-image

The background-image property allows us to place an image behind any HTML element.

Background-repeat property can have four values:

repeat
repeat-x : The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).
repeat-y: The image is repeated vertically only.
no-repeat: The image is only shown once.
fixed: The background image stays in the same position on the page.
scroll: The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

 left center
 left bottom
 center top

 right top

right bottom
The properties must be specified in the following order, but we can miss any value if we do not want to specify it :

1. background-color

2. background-image

3. background-repeat

4. background-attachment

5. background-position

CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box.

Contrast of background images

If we want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.

# Practical Information
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.

The Basics

Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help our site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that our website covers.

* On-Page Techniques

* On-page techniques are the methods we can use on our web pages to improve their rating in search engines.

* Off-Page Techniques

Getting other sites to link to us is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank our site by looking at the number of other sites that link to ours.

In every page of our website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find our site) can appear in order to improve its findability.
